             <p>It's a question as old as food, but what's the answer? We don't know,<br> 
             but we can make some guesses. Some say we eat to survive,<br>
             but I, dear reader, am skeptical.</p>
            <h2>Possible Reasons why we eat</h2>

             <!-- <ul> -->
              <li>For fun!<br>
                Food is more than just nourishment, it's also a blast!</li><br>

              <li><em>Greed</em><br>
                I, for one, like to eat so other people can't. <br>The more food I have, the less they have!</li><br>
